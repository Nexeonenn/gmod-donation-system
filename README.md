# Donation-System (for Garry's Mod)

This is a donation/payment system used mainly for Garry's Mod game. This software was one of the firsts scripts on coderhire, the Garry's Mod software market. I have decided to release it in the hopes that someone else might be interested in fixing it(though I haven't tested it, so it might still be working). 

When I first developed this system, I tried to include as much functionality as I could, to cover as many cases as possible. Of course, with that came in the complexity. Due to the complexity I stopped selling this system, as I didn't have time to support every customer that bought this system.
